Description: The ClusterSignificance package provides tools 
    to assess if class clusters in dimensionality reduced 
    data representations have a separation different from 
    permuted data. The term class clusters here refers to, 
    clusters of points representing known classes in the data. 
    This is particularly useful to determine if a subset of the
    variables, e.g. genes in a specific pathway, alone can 
    separate samples into these established classes. 
    ClusterSignificance accomplishes this by, projecting all 
    points onto a one dimensional line. Cluster separations 
    are then scored and the probability of the seen separation 
    being due to chance is evaluated using a permutation method.
